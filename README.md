# About Me

My name is Ling Cao and I am a rising junior at Cornell University studying Computer Science and pursuing minors in Information Science and Business.

The repositories on this account include some projects that I've worked on. Some projects cannot be transferred from my institutional account due to concerns for university academic integrity policies for assignments.

Feel free to reach out to me at lc686@cornell.edu!
